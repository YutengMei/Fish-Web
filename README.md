This web app provides tools for anglers to discover the best location and time to catch more fish. It includes a feature that allows anglers to share their favorite fishing spots and pictures of the catches with others. It also includes tools such as tide, weather, and solunar forecast for anglers to speculate the best day and time to fish.

## Features
### Map

Fishing is all about location. Thus, a map is an essential component of anglers. This map component contains different fishing spots for anglers to explore. When clicked on a fishing spot, anglers can give it a thumb up by clicking the like button, or they can click on the discuss button, which leads them to the discussion board of this specific fishing spot. 


### Forum

Each fishing spot has a discussion board. Anglers can use it to chat with other anglers who are fishing in this spot. They can also use it to share pictures of the catches. 


### Discover a Fishing Spot?

When anglers discover a new fishing spot and want to share it with other anglers, they can add the fishing spot to the map by either entering the address or coordinate of the place. 


### Tide Prediction

Timing is as important as locations for anglers. The tide forecast feature allows anglers to gain access to tide forecasts for any place by entering the latitude and longitude. Anglers can view the specific time for high tide and low tide for the current day or the next 7 days.  


### Solunar Acitivity Prediction

The solunar theory was proposed by John Alden Knight in 1926, and it can be deduced that the action of the sun and the moon influences the activity of all living beings in nature. The times of day in which living beings show greater activity are the so-called solunar periods. With the solunar prediction feature, anglers can gain access to the solunar rating of the day for any location. The solunar forecast lists out all the major solunar periods of the day. Anglers can use it to plan their fishing trip accordingly.
